# Coming Soon landing page prototype 
 A frontend assessment. This serves as a test and evaluation of design and styling patterns required in frontend development through creating a prototype landing page in jsx.
Create-react-app was used to initiate the react app, as the major requirement was to represent the core features of the page through jsx rendering.
React-router-dom was used for routing, navigation and linking routes.
Other libraries used to improve the UI include react-bootstrap,font-awesome and react-spring.
Classes were styled and animated using pure css.
